# Airbnb Properties Price Prediction

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data/data

In this project, I analyze the New York City Airbnb Open Dataset, which provides a closer look into different features of the Airbnb properties, across New York City. It includes features such as:

- Listing details: Name, room type, and price
- Location data: Neighbourhood group (Manhattan, Brooklyn, etc.), neighborhood, latitude, and longitude
- Host information: Host ID, name, and number of listings managed
- Availability and reviews: Number of reviews, last review date, review scores, and availability over the year

The analysis involves:

1. Project Introduction
2. Import Packages
3. EDA: Overview of the dataset's variables.
4. Feature Extraction
5. Model Training: Building and comparing multiple linear regression models to predict properties price.
6. Model Evaluation
